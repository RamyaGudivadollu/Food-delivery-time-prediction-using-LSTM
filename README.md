# Food Delivery Time Prediction Using LSTM Neural Network

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict food delivery times using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. The model leverages historical delivery data to forecast delivery durations accurately. The core of this project is built using the **LSTM neural network**, which is well-suited for sequential data like time series, making it ideal for this prediction task.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of delivery times, distances, and other relevant variables collected from a food delivery service. It is stored in the CSV file `food_delivery_dataset.csv` provided in this repository.

- **Data**: `food_delivery_dataset.csv` - contains features such as delivery distance, time, and other contextual information relevant for prediction.

## Libraries and Dependencies

This project relies on several key Python libraries that are widely used for data processing, modeling, and visualization.

**Required Libraries:**
- **Numpy**: For numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For data preprocessing and performance evaluation.
- **Keras**: For building the LSTM model.
- **Plotly**: For data visualization.

To install these libraries, you can use the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn keras plotly
```

You can also refer to the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for a full list of dependencies.

## Platforms Used

You can execute the code on any of the following platforms:
- **Google Colab**: Run the project in a cloud environment.

## Model Overview

We employ an **LSTM neural network** to predict delivery times. LSTMs are a powerful form of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that can capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, making them well-suited for time-series forecasting.

**Key Components**:
- **LSTM Layer**: The core layer used for time-series analysis.
- **Dense Layer**: Final output layer that predicts the delivery time.
- **Adam Optimizer**: Used for optimizing the loss function.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: The loss function used to train the model.

The model takes input features like:
- Delivery distance
- Restaurant and customer location details
- Time of day and traffic conditions

The output is the predicted delivery time.

## Results

The LSTM model is evaluated using the **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** metrics. The model shows significant improvement over traditional regression methods and achieves satisfactory accuracy in predicting delivery times.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Food_delivery_time_prediction_using_LSTM.ipynb`) in any of the platforms listed above.
2. Load the dataset (`food_delivery_dataset.csv`).
3. Run the notebook cells step by step to train the model and make predictions.
4. Visualize the results using **Plotly** to better understand the model’s predictions.
